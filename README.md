# Flappy Parrot

An endless runner game which draws inspiration from Flappy Bird, but is 3D and has improved graphics. This game was built in Unity3D. I implemented an AI that plays the game and gets an unlimited high score. There's also a leaderboard for players that love the challenge.

Flappy Parrot is published on Google Play Store. [Click here](https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ApptasticMobile.FlappyParrot) to download and install (if you have an android device).

I decided not to open source the assets along with the source code, for obvious reasons.
